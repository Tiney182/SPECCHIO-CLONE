This is the SPECCHIO Spectral Information System. SPECCHIO was originally 
built by the Remote Sensing Laboratories at the University of Zurich, 
and extended by Intersect for the School of Earth and Environmental 
Sciences at the University of Wollongong.

SPECCHIO consists of a Java web application for accessing a central 
database of spectral data, and a Java client application for viewing and 
manipulating data managed by a SPECCHIO server. The web application is 
designed for use with GlassFish 3.1.2.2 or later and MySQL 5.0 or later.

Please refer to the installation guides and user guide for information 
on how to install and use SPECCHIO.
